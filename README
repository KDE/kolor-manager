"Evaluation" Package

*kmdevices (Kolor Management Devices - Monitor/Printer/etc. profile setup)
*kminfo (Kolor Management Information - Displays specific profile information)
*kmsettings (Kolor Management Settings - Change behavior and policy settings)


-----REQUIRED LIBRARIES---------------------------------------------

-This build is currently using the latest Oyranos build through "gits".  It is
required that Oyranos be up to date using this


-----INSTALLATION----------------------------------------------------

Enter the following commands in the "build" directory:

cmake ..
make
make install


-----RUNNING-------------------------------------------------------

-This build should install a "Kolor Management" icon in the KDE4 settings window, under "Computer Administration".  An alternative method for running the individual modules would be to type this in a terminal:

kcmshell4 [KMMODULE]     (Where KMMODULE is "kmdevices", "kminfo", or "kmsettings")  

This is handy for displaying debug information through the console.


-----BUILD NOTES-----------------------------------------------

The following files are installed under each module directory.  They are shown here for reference:

MODULE.cpp (source code)
MODULE.h (header)
MODULE.ui (Qt Designer file)
icons.qrc (resource file for icons in 'kmdevices' and 'kminfo')
ui_MODULE.h (Qt designer header file - for hand coding purposes)
CMakeLists.txt (build instructions for each module)

-----MAJOR CHANGES FROM LAST TEST BUILDS---------------------------------------

GENERAL
-Icons should now be visible (kmdevices/kminfo)
-Column widths are now tidied up.


-----CURRENT ISSUES (FIXME)----------------------------------------------------

The following issues, shall be forwarded as "FIXMEs" from here on:

KMSETTINGS
-The configuration has to be ported to a Oyranos configure object to manipulate
settings and then apply at once. This is currently not possible, as each setting
is imediately aplpied to the Oyranos settings DB.  

KMDEVICES
-Camera support needs to be outlined first

KMINFO
-There needs to be a way to refresh the profile listing every time a change has been made in 'devices' and 'settings' modules.  Right now, the user must restart Kolor Manager in order to see 
the profile listing to be changed in Information.
